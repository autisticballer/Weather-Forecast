Project Description: Weather Data Fetching and Displaying Application
This project is a simple Java-based application that fetches weather data from a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap), parses the JSON response, and displays relevant weather information in a user-friendly format.



1. Tools Used
       Programming Language:
          Java: The project is implemented in Java, which is a widely used object-oriented programming language. Java is well-known for its platform independence, robust standard libraries, and versatility in 
          building console and GUI applications.


       Libraries:
          org.json library: This is a lightweight library used for parsing and manipulating JSON data in Java. It simplifies handling of JSON objects and arrays, which is essential for processing the API response.
          Version: json-20230227.jar (This version of the library is used in the project).


       API:
          OpenWeatherMap API: This is a public API used to fetch weather data in JSON format. It provides real-time weather information including temperature, humidity, weather description, etc.
          Endpoint: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city_name}&appid={API_key}.


       Tools:
          Command-Line Interface (CLI): The application is executed in the terminal, making it simple to run and test the Java program.
          JAR File: The json-20230227.jar file is added to the project as an external dependency for handling JSON parsing






2. Development Environment (Editor and Platform)

   
      IDE/Editor:
          Visual Studio Code (VS Code): This lightweight code editor is used for writing and editing Java code. It's favored for its flexibility and support for various programming languages and extensions.


      Key features:
          Syntax highlighting and IntelliSense for Java.
          Integrated terminal for running commands.
          Extensions to handle Java code (e.g., Java Extension Pack for VS Code).


      Alternative Editor: 
          Any Java-compatible text editor can be used (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse), but this project uses VS Code for its simplicity and versatility.



      Platform:
          Operating System: The application can run on any platform with Java support (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).



      Terminal/Command Prompt: 
          Command-line terminal (VS Code terminal, Windows Command Prompt, or macOS/Linux terminal) is used to compile and run the program.

4. Use of This Project (Applicability)
This type of application can be useful in various real-world scenarios:

       Weather Forecasting Applications:
             Developers can integrate this functionality into larger weather forecasting systems or mobile apps that provide weather updates.
             It can be extended to show forecasts, historical data, and display weather on a map.


       Travel and Tourism:
             Tourists can use apps that fetch real-time weather updates for their destinations. It can be integrated into a travel app to offer weather forecasts based on location.



       Smart Home Systems:
             This project can be integrated into smart home applications to control temperature, lighting, or adjust home settings based on current weather conditions. For example, adjusting thermostat settings 
             depending on the outside temperature.

   
       Emergency and Disaster Relief Systems:
             Emergency response systems that rely on weather conditions can use this data to help decision-making, e.g., tracking storm systems and providing relevant data to the public.



       Data Science and Analytics:
             Weather data is often used in data analysis projects to model trends in temperature, precipitation, and other weather patterns. This data could be fed into machine learning algorithms for predictive              nalytics.
